# Repository Atlas: oh-my-opencode-slim

## Project Responsibility

`oh-my-opencode-slim` is an OpenCode plugin that implements a specialist-agent operating model on top of the host runtime. Its core responsibilities include:

- Defining orchestrator and specialist agent factories with permission policies
- Loading layered plugin configuration and per-agent permissions
- Exposing additional tools and MCP integrations
- Managing background job-board orchestration and terminal multiplexer visualization
- Injecting workflow-enforcement hooks plus runtime command handlers
- Shipping install-time skills and a bootstrap CLI

This codemap covers the plugin repository itself and excludes the nested `opencode/` upstream checkout.

## System Entry Points

## Runtime Control Flow

1. **Plugin startup**
   - OpenCode loads `src/index.ts`.
   - Config is loaded and normalized through `src/config/`.
   - Agent definitions are produced by `src/agents/`.
   - Tool factories from `src/tools/` and MCP definitions from `src/mcp/` are registered.
   - Hooks from `src/hooks/` are attached.
   - Delegation/council orchestration, multiplexer session mirroring, interview support, task-session aliasing, and runtime preset handling are initialized.

2. **Interactive request handling**
   - The orchestrator prompt drives routing decisions.
   - Tool calls resolve through `src/tools/` or built-in OpenCode tools.
   - Hooks can transform prompts/messages, normalize system message arrays, repair tool failures, or intercept runtime commands before/after execution.

3. **Delegated execution**
   - Native OpenCode background tasks are parsed from `task` output and injected completion messages and tracked in the shared background job board.
   - `src/hooks/task-session-manager/` updates job-board state, resolves short aliases, and injects background/reusable job context into the orchestrator prompt.
   - `src/multiplexer/` optionally mirrors those sessions into tmux/zellij panes.
   - Results flow back into the parent session through notifications/output polling.

4. **Install/release path**
   - `src/cli/` configures host OpenCode instances.
   - `src/skills/` is copied into the user skill directory.
   - `scripts/` validates generated schema, package completeness, and host-load behavior.

## Key Cross-Module Integration Points

- `src/index.ts` is the central composition root for nearly every runtime subsystem.
- `src/config/` feeds `src/agents/`, session/delegation utilities, and MCP registration.
- `src/cli/skills.ts` and `src/cli/custom-skills.ts` bridge install-time skill packaging with runtime permission policy.
- Session/delegation utilities depend on `src/multiplexer/` and cooperate with helpers in `src/utils/` for depth tracking, result extraction, task output parsing, and alias state.
- `src/tools/council.ts` delegates into `src/council/`.
- `src/tools/preset-manager.ts` hooks command execution and updates runtime agent models from configured presets.
- `src/hooks/task-session-manager/` depends on `src/utils/background-job-board.ts` and `src/utils/task.ts` to support background task tracking, task output parsing, and safe alias reuse.
- `src/hooks/filter-available-skills/` and agent permission logic rely on shared skill names from the CLI/config layer.
- `src/interview/` hooks into plugin command/event surfaces exposed by `src/index.ts`.
